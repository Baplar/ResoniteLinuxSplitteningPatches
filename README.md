# Linux Splittening Patches

A repository of information for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) to allow the pre-release Splittening builds to run as well as possible on Linux.

The current pre-release can now be started on Linux out of the box! It only requires a few manual tricks for very specific use cases.

## Native Linux build

It is possible to run the main FrooxEngine process in the native Linux .NET runtime, while only the Unity renderer will still run in Wine or Proton.

It works out of the box today, and it is going to be the approach that is taken for the official release of the Splittening.

Make sure to explicitly select a Proton version in the Compatibility menu of the Steam properties for Resonite. We recommend the latest stable (9.0-4 as of today) or Experimental.

### Remaining Linux-specific issues

#### Clipboard
The clipboard does not work on Linux yet, because it currently depends on Windows-specific API functions provided by the .NET runtime.
[SDL is currently being implemented to support this feature on Linux](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/4974).

In the meantime, there is a small RML mod that supports only basic plain-text copy from desktop to Resonite, to get at least some basic functionality working. You can download it [here](https://github.com/Baplar/ResoniteLinuxSplitteningPatches/releases/download/v0.1.10/JankyLinuxClipboard.dll).
If you donâ€™t have Resonite Mod Loader installed yet, you can find a compiled build of it [here](https://github.com/Baplar/ResoniteLinuxSplitteningPatches/releases/download/v0.1.10/RML_Splittening.zip).

#### Visemes
Visemes (voice-controlled lip animations) can not be computed on Linux.
Linux players can see visemes on Windows players, and Windows players can see them on everyone, but Linux players can not see their own visemes, nor those of other Linux players.

[Community efforts are being made to find or provide a cross-platform alternative to the Windows-only OVRLipSync library](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/5151).

In the meantime, there is a small RML mod by KyuubiYoru that implements a form of viseme computation on Linux.
It is still a work in progress, but you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/VisemesAtHome/releases/latest).
